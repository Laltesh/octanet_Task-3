        <p></p> Art is an expression that makes use of the cultural symbols. 
        The archive of the collective memories of a culture is perceived to be drawing, sculpture, poetry, literature and other media. Art retains what fact-based historical documents do not:
         how it felt at a certain time to live in a specific period.
         Motif is a decorative image or design, especially a repeated one forming a pattern.
